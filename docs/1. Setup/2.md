# Installing Hyper-V
Do not install two Hypervisors on your PC. You can use Hyper-V or VMWare Workstation, but you should not install both! 

The procedure to install Hyper-V has changed a little and depends on the version of Windows that you are using. Assuming a recent version, open the dialogue to turn Windows features on or off. Click on okay to install, and you need to do a restart after the installation. 

After the computer is restarted, you should have both Hyper V and its associated management tools installed. From the search bar, type Hyper V and confirm that you can see the management tool. I normally write click on any important program and pin it to the taskbar. I can see what’s installed on any of my PCs and all the important programs are just one click away.
