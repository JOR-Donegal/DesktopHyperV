There are some specific requirements before you can use your Windows 10/11 computer as a virtualization platform. The first thing we need to do is to understand what hardware is in the computer.

## Verifying the CPU
We can verify most of what we need using __systeminfo.exe__ from the command prompt. In the example below, I’m running a Windows 10 Enterprise instance on a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). However, it has been configured to run Hyper-V.

In the screenshot I can see exactly the type of processor I have, the motherboard, and how much DRAM I have (32GB). At the end of this screenshot I can see the status of four critical properties for virtualization. And they are all good! There are other things I can see that are mandatory for virtualization;

- A 64-bit version of Windows.
- The professional version.
- Enough main memory (32GB); you need at least 8GB.

## Verifying secondary storage
I also need to map the available hard disks and see if I have suitable secondary storage for virtual machines. If I run __diskpart__ and then type the command __list disk__, I can get an idea of what disks are in my system.

But I also need to determine which disks are spinning discs (HDD) and which are solid-state (SSD). A quick way to do this is to run __dfrgui__, the defragmentation tool. I can clearly see the drive types in my system.

My configuration is actually pretty good. 

- C:\ is a small SSD specifically intended for the host operating system. 
- I have a dedicated disk E:\ for synchronizing my cloud shares
- I have a separate dedicated disk F:\ for holding static information, like ISO files. 
- Finally, I have a dedicated SSD G:\ for VM’s.

If I was running a lot of VM’s, I could improve the performance by adding more, small SSD’s.
