# Setup

There are some specific requirements before you can use your Windows 10/11 computer as a virtualization platform. The first thing we need to do is to understand what hardware is in the computer.

## Verifying the CPU

We can verify most of what we need using __systeminfo.exe__ from the command prompt. In the example below, I’m running a Windows 10 Enterprise instance on a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). However, it has been configured to run Hyper-V.

In the screenshot I can see exactly the type of processor I have, the motherboard, and how much DRAM I have (32GB). At the end of this screenshot I can see the status of four critical properties for virtualization. And they are all good! There are other things I can see that are mandatory for virtualization;
- A 64-bit version of Windows.
- The professional version.
- Enough main memory (32GB); you need at least 8GB.
